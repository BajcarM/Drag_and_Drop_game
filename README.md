# Drag_and_Drop_game
Choose how many rows and columns you want and press SHUFFLE button. Then you can play and reconstruct the image. Works on touchscreens too

You can choose the number of tiles so make it harder.

Shuffle uses sequence of many random moves so every time image CAN be reconstructed.

Try it!!!
